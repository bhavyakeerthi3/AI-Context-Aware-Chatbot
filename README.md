## 📌 Overview

**Aura AI** is a production-grade, context-aware conversational intelligence platform designed to deliver high-quality customer support and product engagement experiences. It leverages a high-performance **FastAPI** backend and a modern **React** frontend to demonstrate the practical application of advanced Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and real-time session memory.

Unlike conventional chatbots that respond in isolation, Aura AI maintains conversational context across turns, enabling intelligent follow-up responses and coherent multi-step interactions.

---

## 🎯 Key Capabilities

### 🧠 Advanced Natural Language Understanding
- **Context Preservation** – Maintains session-level memory for multi-turn conversations.
- **Intent Classification** – Accurately identifies user goals such as Support Requests, Product Inquiries, and Order Status Checks.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** – Extracts product names, variants, and key attributes to ground conversations in real data.

### 🏢 System Architecture & Design
- **Core NLU Engine** – Lightweight, dependency-optimized Python engine engineered for speed and stability.
- **Knowledge-Grounded Responses** – Answers retrieved from a structured knowledge base to ensure factual correctness.
- **Modern User Interface** – Glassmorphic React interface with smooth animations and real-time typing indicators.

### ⚙ Performance & Reliability
- **Asynchronous FastAPI** endpoints for low-latency responses.
- **Stateless API** with session-based memory management.
- **Modular architecture** enabling easy extension and scaling.

## � Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+ 🐍
- Node.js & npm 📦

### 1️⃣ Backend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to root
cd Conversational-AI-Chatbot

# Install requirements
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic requests

# Start the server
python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8002
```

### 2️⃣ Frontend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to frontend folder
cd frontend-react

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the React dev server
npm run dev -- --port 3001
```

---

## 🧪 Interactive Demo

Once both servers are running, navigate to `http://localhost:3001`.

### Try this flow:
1. **User**: "Tell me about the MacBook Pro."
2. **User**: "How much does it cost?"
3. **Aura**: *Recognizes "it" as the MacBook Pro and retrieves the price from the Knowledge Base.*
